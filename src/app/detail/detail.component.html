    Deferrable views in Angular are a powerful tool to streamline initial load times and enhance user experience.
    Benefits of Deferrable Views
</p>
<p>
    Reduced Initial Bundle Size: By deferring the loading of certain dependencies, you minimize the initial bundle size
    of your Angular application. This leads to faster load times and improved performance.
    Improved User Experience: Deferrable views prioritize rendering critical content while non-essential components load
    in the background.
    Syntax and Implementation:
</p>
<p>
    Use the defer block to encapsulate content that should be lazily loaded. This content remains unrendered initially
    and becomes visible once specified triggers or conditions are met.
</p>

<p>
    Optionally, add a placeholder block to display temporary content before the main content loads. You can specify a
    minimum time for the placeholder to prevent flickering.
    Consider using the loading block to show loading indicators during deferred dependency loading.
